#SmartCard

This is an application I'm working on very similar to one I previously worked on with two other classmates called Solidify As of today it has some of the CRUD functionality with being able to Create and Read the flashcards I am working to add in Authentication and Authorization so that only users that are logged in are allowed to create cards and only delete one they have made I have not deployed the front or back-end so everything is running on the localhost
